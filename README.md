# 3D Navigation in pure CSS

A simple 3d box stacked navigation written in pure css.

# Technology Used

1. Vite - To create a server. I find it the lightest and fastest solution for vanilla projects, simpler than webpack.
2. CSS and HTML.

# Usage

1. Clone the repo.
2. yarn
3. yarn run dev --host

The terminal will give you a local server.

Now simply edit the HTML file.
